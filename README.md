# NEOC-Project
New Element's Object Crew; a project for the conversion and correction/improvement of the most commonly used RCT objects to the .parkobj format.

Goals:
  1. Convert the most commonly used DAT objects to the new .parkobj format
  2. Add corrections, completions, and consistency to the objects (cursors, buy/sell price, etc.)
  3. Add simpler naming conventions and translations
  4. Complete missing objects from previous sets of objects (base blocks for all textures, all wall heights)
  5. Create objects for commonly used trackitecture
  6. Create additional useful objects from NCSO textures/object basis.

Walls:
  1. Add slopes to all the wall objects
  2. We decided on 1 pixel thickness for all the walls
  3. Complete missing heights of certain textures

Doors/Windows:
  1. Current plan is the following format for each wall texture/color:
    A. Square door (opens/closes)
    B. Alternate door (portcullis, steel door?)
    B. Square window (based on NCSO) (shutters open/close)
    C. Alternate window (specific to texture) (shutters open/close)
  2. Arches (round) for each texture/color
  3. Decide if arches should have colorable frame

Fences:
  1. Current plan is the following format for each fence type:
    A. 1 height fence
    B. 2 height fence
    C. 2 height fence with gate (opens/closes?)
  2. Likely will need to correct any sloped images of CSO fences

Roofs:
  (Undecided)
  
Foliage:
  1. Add different views for useful CSO shrubs with automatic rotation
  2. Make trees colorable and automatically rotate
  3. Any custom flower objects should be able to wither

Theming Objects:
  1. Some theming may be useful to automatically rotate
  2. Correct some colorable theming objects (e.g. barrels too dark)
  3. Proposing some generic sign options

Trackitecture:
  1. Current brainstorm is to add monorail, steeplechase
  2. Wooden track for catwalks vs. 4d catwalks; (would want turns to have catwalks too)

Supports/Rides:
  1. Have to decide on B&M supports vs classic pipes
  2. If classic style supports, thick slanted support needs improved
  3. Decide on footer style?
  4. Some additional ride detail objects would be useful (e.g. control box)

Landscaping:
  1. Proposing 1/4 and diagonal 1/4 white water
  2. Full tile land blocks for all textures?
  3. Correct old 1/4 land blocks to not have grid
